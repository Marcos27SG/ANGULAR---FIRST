Hello There!

This is my first project in angular so... 
I forgot that first you need to create the project and then add the project to the repository hahaha
At the result of my error the project is inside of the carpet "firstapp"
There u will find the actual project xd and the command to run the project 
Good luck and have fun!! 

Regards,
MRSG
